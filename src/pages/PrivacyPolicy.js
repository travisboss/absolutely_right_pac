              </li>
              <li>
                We will use this information as aggregate data to help us
                maintain this site, e.g., to determine the number of visitors to
                different sections of our site, to ensure the site is working
                properly, and to help us make our site more accessible and

                We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you

            <h3 className="major">OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
            <p>
              If you choose to identify yourself (or otherwise provide us with
              personal information) when you use our online forms:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We will collect (and may retain) any personally identifying
                information, such as your name, street address, email address,
                and phone number, and any other information you provide. We will
                use this information to try to fulfill your request and may use
                it to provide you with additional information at a later time.
                We may share your information with third parties.
              </li>

                If you request information, services, or assistance, we may
                disclose your personal information to those third parties that
                (in our judgment) are appropriate in order to fulfill your
                request. If, when you provide us with such information, you
                specify that you do not want us to disclose the information to
                third parties, we will honor your request. Note, however, that
                if you do not provide such information, it may be impossible for
                us to refer, respond to, or fulfill your request.
              </li>
              <li>
                If your communication relates to a law enforcement matter, we
                may disclose the information to law enforcement agencies that we
                deem appropriate.
              </li>

            <h3 className="major">HOW LONG WE KEEP INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
              We may keep information that will collect for an unlimited period
              of time.

            <h3 className="major">USE OF COOKIES</h3>
            <p>
              Our website may use “cookies” to enhance your experience. Your web
              browser places cookies on its hard drive for record-keeping
              purposes and sometimes to track information about it. You may
              choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you
              when cookies are being sent. If you do so, note that some parts of
              the website may not function properly.
            </p>
            <h3 className="major">GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h3>
            <p>
              We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information
              about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such
              as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit, when
              they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this
              site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to
              improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address
              assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your
              name or other identifying information. We do not combine the
              information collected through the use of Google Analytics with
              personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics
              plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a
              unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot
              be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share
              information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to
              this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and
              the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from
              recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies
              on your browser.

              We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s

              collect or maintain personal information from anyone under 13

            <h3 className="major">LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h3>
            <p>
              Our website may contain links to other websites. Any personal
              information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly
              to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy
              policy. This Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we
              are not responsible for the content or privacy and security
              practices and policies of these websites or any other sites that
              are linked to from our website. We suggest you to learn about
              their privacy and security practices and policies before providing
              them with personal information.
            </p>
            <h3 className="major">SECURITY</h3>
            <p>
              We take reasonable precautions to protect your information in an
              effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
              disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however,
              that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
              impenetrable and no method of data transmission that can be
              guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
            </p>

            <p>
              Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card
              data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a
              secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon
              at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the
              beginning of the address of the web page.
            </p>

            <p>
              While we use encryption to protect sensitive information
              transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only
              employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
              example, billing or customer service) are granted access to
              personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in
              which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a
              secure environment.
