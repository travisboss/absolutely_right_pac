              Absolutely Right will focus on races up-and-down the ballot in
              which the outcome will have significant impact, immediately and
              for years to come, with an emphasis towards engaging in
              under-the-radar and underserved races, which donâ€™t garner much
              attention, yet the result of which would significantly alter the
              political landscape.
